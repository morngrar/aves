# Aves

Aves is an android app made in conjunction with a university course in mobile app development. The idea is to give bird enthusiasts an app to record their observations of birds, and the app contains a searchable database of many birds known to be seen in Norway. The goal of the app was to be able to place the observations geographically and temporally, as well as gather weather data at the specific location and time of the observation, to over time be able to discern possible patterns.

The user was also fitted with a 'bird radar' which would show any observations that had been done close-by. The app currently doesn't funtion fully, beacause the upstream weather-API has changed.
