# First iteration of Aves

Aves is an app for recording observations of birds. This is an early version, which needs a few more changes to be ready for google play.

# Important when testing the app
 - The app requires a connection to a firestore backend, so instead of setting this up yourself, use the [APK](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ukm9dp7wnwbe6ok/aves-alpha1.apk?dl=1) we have provided for you, simply start your emulator and drag-drop it onto the emulator screen to install it.
 - Use an emulator that has google play installed
